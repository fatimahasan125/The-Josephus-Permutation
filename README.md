# The-Josephus-Permutation
A small animation of the Josephus Problem using Dynamic Arrays in C++

In computer science and mathematics, the Josephus problem (or Josephus permutation) is a theoretical problem related to a certain counting-out game. People are standing in a circle waiting to be executed. Counting begins at a specified point in the circle and proceeds around the circle in a specified direction. After a specified number of people are skipped, the next person is executed. The procedure is repeated with the remaining people, starting with the next person, going in the same direction and skipping the same number of people, until only one person remains, and is freed.

The problem — given the number of people, starting point, direction, and number to be skipped — is to choose the position in the initial circle to avoid execution.

For this animation, the number of people are taken as input from the user. The starting point is the first persion, direction is clockwise and the number to be skipped is equal to the number of total people. There is a small variation from the original problem though. People are standing in a rectangle and after a number of pre defined iterations, some new people are added in the rectangle to be executed. Blue colour represents the people who are being skipped and red means that person is executed. 


An example of the animation is shown below
